## Introduction
City Guide is significant whenever the people visiting a particular city. It gives them the valuable information about the places, people, and the culture of the town. In that case we are wasting our time and money by depending the guide of the city. This proposed idea provides a web-based concept for the people who wants to visit a city can search each and every place within the city without taking the assistance of any personal guide. We can search in that website about the city for its prominent places and may get social and political information of the city, city culture, security, entertainment, Business, Hotels, Jobs, etc., The main aim of this project is to provide the services to the users who have registered within the site. This is a web-based software developed in Java programming language and SQL database system to store the blue-print of a city. This is composed of two main modules which may also include many sub modules. This technique provides a registration form for all who wants to urge the services. The registration form is different for different categories. All the users are going to be first considered as anonymous user, later if he/she needs any service then he/she need to fill up the registration form and they are treated as registered user. They need to give their 'User-ID' and 'Password' which are used at the time of
registration for security purpose and in need of their 'Account- Number ' only at the time of transactional providence.
